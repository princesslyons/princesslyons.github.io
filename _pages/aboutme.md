# Hi, I'm Princess!

I'm a downtown Chicago-born and raised, computer engineer and soccer enthusiast who enjoys watching Netflix and telenovelas, traveling and most importantly tacos! [Master of Science](#Education)

I'm currently a Ph.D. student at the University of Florida (UF) in the Biometrics and Machine Learning lab, working with [Dr. Damon Woodard](http://damonwoodard.com). Here, I'm working on topics such as data analytics, machine learning and natural language processing. My current project involves multi-language authorship attribution. How did I get here?

My passion for technology and electronics led me to becoming an engineer! I completed a dual Bachelor of Science in Electrical and Computer Engineering as a Honors Scholar with minors in Mathematics, Computer Science and Spanish at the University of Missouri-Columbia (Mizzou). My research curiosities blossomed when I joined the Undergraduate Research Program under [Dr. Alina Zare](https://faculty.eng.ufl.edu/machine-learning/people/faculty/) where I worked on algorithm development and machine learning.

After undergrad, I enrolled in the masters program at UF and earned a Graduate Research Assistantship. Again, under the guidance of Dr. Zare, I studied machine learning and image processing in the [Machine Learning and Sensing lab](https://faculty.eng.ufl.edu/machine-learning/machine-learning-sensing-lab/). My research focused on unsupervised and supervised methods for object detection in synthetic aperture SONAR imagery. In the fall of 2019, I successfully defended my thesis titled, "Anomaly and Target Detection in Synthetic Aperture SONAR" and earned my master's degree. Up next... Dr. Princess Lyons :-)
