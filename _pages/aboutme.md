## [Hi, I'm Princess!](#intro)
I'm a computer engineer and soccer enthusiast from downtown Chicago who enjoys watching Netflix and telenovelas, traveling and most importantly playing FIFA!

I'm currently a Ph.D. student at the University of Florida (UF) working in the Florida Institute for National Security (FINS). I am a graduate research assistant in the Applied Artificial Intelligence Group with [Dr. Damon Woodard](http://damonwoodard.com) as my advisor. Here, I'm working on topics such as data analytics, machine learning and natural language processing. My current project involves cross-lingual authorship attribution.

I completed a dual B.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering as a Honors Scholar at the University of Missouri-Columbia (Mizzou) working with [Dr. Alina Zare](https://faculty.eng.ufl.edu/machine-learning/people/faculty/) where my research involved algorithm development and machine learning.

After undergrad, I enrolled in the masters program at UF where I studied machine learning and image processing in the [Machine Learning and Sensing lab](https://faculty.eng.ufl.edu/machine-learning/machine-learning-sensing-lab/) again with Dr. Zare. My research focused on unsupervised and supervised methods for object detection in synthetic aperture SONAR imagery. In the fall of 2019, I successfully defended my thesis, earning my M.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering.
