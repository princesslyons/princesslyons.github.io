Born and raised in downtown Chicago, IL, I was always an avid learner. I continuously excelled in academics and decided to pursue a degree in International Business at the University of Missouri-Columbia. After completing my first year in business, my passion for technology and electronics soon took over the direction of my education. It became apparent that transitioning my studies to engineering would be more fulfilling. In the spring of 2017, I completed a dual Bachelor of Science in Electrical and Computer Engineering as a Honors Scholar with minors in Mathematics, Computer Science and Spanish. Throughout this journey I participated in multiple campus activities and held leadership positions in organizations such as the Institute for Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE). During my junior year, I joined the Undergraduate Research Program and gained an interest in algorithm development and machine learning while working in the Machine Learning and Sensing lab under [Dr. Alina Zare](https://faculty.eng.ufl.edu/machine-learning/people/faculty/). I then attended an IEEE conference to present my research on heartbeat characterization using ballistocardiogram signals where the idea of graduate school blossomed into a reality.

After undergrad, I enrolled in the Master of Science in Electrical and Computer Engineering program at the University of Florida. There she studied machine learning and image processing again under the supervision of Dr. Alina Zare. Here, my research focused on unsupervised and supervised methods for object detection in synthetic aperture SONAR imagery. I successfully defended my thesis titled, "Anomaly and Target Detection in Synthetic Aperture SONAR" and earned my master's degree.
