This page is dedicated to my loving mother who taught and cultivated an engineer. My mom is the reason I am an engineer today. She continuously indulged my curiosity and encouraged me to reach new heights. Not only did she do this for me, but a community of individuals I'm fortunate enough to call friends and family. Forever in my heart and with me on this journey. Thank you, mom. I love you.
    - Your Dr. Daughter
