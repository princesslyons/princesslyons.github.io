Forever dedicated to my loving mother who taught and cultivated an engineer. My mom is the reason I am an engineer today. She continuously indulged my curiosity and encouraged me to reach new heights. Heights that we never imagined. Not only did she do this for me, but a community of individuals I'm fortunate enough to call family and friends. She was one of a kind. Forever in my heart and with me on this journey. Thank you, mom. I love you.

  -- Your Dr. Daughter
